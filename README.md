WordWise
WordWise is a word guessing game where users guess an English word based on its Turkish meaning. The app is built using Flutter for the frontend and Slim Framework for the backend API.

Project Structure
This project consists of two main parts:

Frontend: A mobile application built using Flutter.

Backend: A RESTful API built using Slim Framework and PHP.

Frontend (Flutter)
The frontend is developed using Flutter, providing a cross-platform experience. It allows users to start new games, make letter guesses, view their game history, and track their statistics.

Technologies and Packages Used:
Flutter SDK: A UI toolkit for building natively compiled applications.

Dart: The programming language used for Flutter development.

http: A package for making HTTP requests to the backend API.

shared_preferences: Used for storing user authentication tokens securely on the device.

Features:
User Login and Registration: Users can log in with a username and password. New users can register and log in to start playing.

Start New Game: Users can select a difficulty level (Beginner, Intermediate, Advanced) and start a new game.

Letter Guessing: The user guesses letters of an English word based on the provided Turkish meaning.

Hangman Animation: The game features an ASCII-based Hangman figure that updates with every incorrect guess.

Game History and Statistics: Users can view their past games, track their wins/losses, and monitor their game statistics.

Backend (Slim Framework & PHP)
The backend is developed with PHP Slim Framework, which is a lightweight framework for building REST APIs. This backend handles user authentication, game logic, and interactions with the database.

Technologies Used:
PHP: The server-side language used for backend development.

Slim Framework: A PHP micro-framework used for building the REST API.

JWT (JSON Web Token): Used for user authentication and session management.

MySQL: Relational database management system to store game data and user information.

API Features:
User Management:

User Registration (POST /register): Register a new user.

User Login (POST /login): Login a user and issue a JWT token for authentication.

Game Management:

Start a New Game (POST /start-game): Start a new game based on selected difficulty level. A random word is chosen, and a game record is created.

Letter Guessing (POST /guess-letter): The user guesses a letter, and the system checks if itâ€™s correct.

Game Status (GET /game-status/{gameId}): Retrieve the current status of the game, including guessed letters and remaining attempts.

Database Management:

Tables: Users (users), Games (games), Guesses (guesses), Stats, and Words (words).

JWT: Used for secure user authentication.

Database Tables:
users: Stores user data (id, username, password_hash).

games: Stores game data (id, user_id, word, level, is_won, attempts_left).

guesses: Stores letter guesses (game_id, letter, is_correct).

words: Stores words for each difficulty level (word_en, word_tr, level).
